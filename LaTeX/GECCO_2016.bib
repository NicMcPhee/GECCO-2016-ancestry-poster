  abstract =     "We describe a broad class of problems, called
                 uncompromising problems, characterised by the
                 requirement that solutions must perform optimally on
                 each of many test cases. Many of the problems that have
                 long motivated genetic programming research, including
                 the automation of many traditional programming tasks,
                 are uncompromising. We describe and analyse the
                 recently proposed lexicase parent selection algorition
                 and show that it can facilitate the solution of
                 uncompromising problems by genetic programming. Unlike
                 most traditional parent selection techniques, lexicase
                 selection does not base selection on a fitness value
                 that is aggregated over all test cases; rather, it
                 considers test cases one at a time in random order. We
                 present results comparing lexicase selection to more
                 traditional parent selection methods, including
                 standard tournament selection and implicit fitness
                 sharing, on four uncompromising problems: finding terms
                 in finite algebras, designing digital multipliers,
                 counting words in files, and performing symbolic
                 regression of the factorial function. We provide
                 evidence that lexicase selection maintains higher
                 levels of population diversity than other selection
                 methods, which may partially explain its utility as a
                 parent selection algorithm in the context of
                 uncompromising problems.",

  abstract =	"Several genetic programming researchers have argued
		 for the utility of genetic operators that act
		 uniformly. By act uniformly we mean two specific
		 things: that the probability of an inherited program
		 component being modified during inheritance is
		 independent of the size and shape of the parent
		 programs beyond the component in question; and that
		 pairs of parents are combined in ways that allow
		 arbitrary combinations of components from each parent
		 to appear in the child. Uniform operators described in
		 previous work have had limited utility, however,
		 because of a mismatch between the relevant notions of
		 uniformity and the hierarchical structure and variable
		 sizes of many genetic programming representations. In
		 this chapter we describe a new genetic operator, ULTRA,
		 which incorporates aspects of both mutation and
		 crossover and acts approximately uniformly across
		 programs of variable sizes and structures. ULTRA treats
		 hierarchical programs as linear sequences and includes
		 a repair step to ensure that syntax constraints are
		 satisfied after variation. We show that on the drug
		 bioavailability and Pagie-1 benchmark problems ULTRA
		 produces significant improvements both in
		 problem-solving power and in program size relative to
		 standard operators. Experiments with factorial
		 regression and with the Boolean 6-multiplexer problem
		 demonstrate that ULTRA can manipulate programs that
		 make use of hierarchical structure, but also that it is
		 not always beneficial. The demonstrations evolve
		 programs in the Push programming language, which makes
		 repair particularly simple, but versions of the
		 technique should be applicable in other genetic
		 programming systems as well.",
